# __Project 1: EDA Project__

## __King County Real Estate__

This notebook is about my first EDA project during the Data Science bootcamp at neue fische. 

[Notebook](Project_1/notebooks): Jupyter Notebook

[Images](Project_1/images): Images, plots and maps.

[Dataset](Project_1/data): I used the King County House Sales dataset. Here, the focus is on EDA though it was required to demonstrate an entire Data Science Lifecycle using linear regression. The task will be to perform an extensive EDA and to train a explanatory linear regression model. The task is not only to explain the data but also to evaluate how well the model is fitting the data.

# __Project 2: Machine Learning__

## __AirQo Ugandan Air Quality Forecast Challenge__

This notebook is about my second project during the Data Science bootcamp at neue fische. 

[Notebook](https://github.com/IronMan2483/Projects/blob/main/Project_2/notebook/Air_quality_Uganda_final.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook

[Images](https://github.com/IronMan2483/Projects/tree/main/Project_2/images): Images, plots and maps.

[Dataset]: The [dataset](https://zindi.africa/competitions/airqo-ugandan-air-quality-forecast-challenge/data) is from a challenge which was created on Zindi, the data science competition platform with the mission of building the data science ecosystem in Africa. The objective of this challenge is to accurately forecast air quality (as measured by PM2.5 Âµ/m3) for each hour of the coming 25 hours across five locations in Kampala Uganda. Forecasts will be based on the past 5 days of hourly air quality measurements at each site.
Zindi provided .csv files with train and test data but also meta data with location details. The meta data was excluded in the project.
