# Projects

Welcome to my projects overview.

# __Project 1: EDA Project__

## __King County Real Estate__

This notebook is about my first EDA project during the Data Science bootcamp at neue fische. 

[Notebook](Project_1/notebooks): Jupyter Notebook and Markdown file

[Images](Project_1/images): Created images, plots and maps.

[Dataset](Project_1/data): I used the King County House Sales dataset. Here, the focus is on EDA though it was required to demonstrate an entire Data Science Lifecycle using linear regression. The task will be to perform an extensive EDA and to train a explanatory linear regression model. The task is not only to explain the data but also to evaluate how well the model is fitting the data.

### __Where is King County?__

King County is located in the U.S. state of Washington. The population was 2,269,675 in the 2020 census, making it the most populous county in Washington, and the 12th-most populous in the United States. The county seat is Seattle, also the state's most populous city. King County is one of three Washington counties that are included in the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue metropolitan statistical area. (The others are Snohomish County to the north, and Pierce County to the south.) About two-thirds of King County's population lives in Seattle's suburbs. (definition source: wikipedia)

### __Tasks__

I created a new repo using the template. Through EDA/statistical analysis above I came up with AT LEAST 3 insights/recommendations for me stakeholder. Note, I could take either the perspective of a buyer or a seller and chose the stakeholder from the given list.

### __The Deliverables (given from the DS bootcamp from neue fische)__

* New repository from template
* A well documented Jupyter Notebook containing the code you've written for this project and comments explaining it. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project. Do not push all the analysis... just the analysis that is relevant!
* An organized README.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.
* A short Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides/Jupyter slides presentation giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. The duration of the presentation should be 10 minutes, then the discussion will continue for 5 minutes. Also put your slides (delivered as a PDF export) on Github to get a well-rounded project.

### __Stakeholder__

I selected the following one from the list given in the bootcamp:

* name: Jacob Phillips
* stakeholder: Buyer
* characteristics: Unlimited Budget, 4+ bathrooms or smaller house nearby, big lot (tennis court & pool), golf, historic, no waterfront

So it is most important for this stakeholder especially - so not only for every property in Real Estate: 
__"Location, location, location!"__ 

It is the RE agent's mantra which means that homes can vary widely in value due to their locations. Location is essential when it comes to the value of a property.
